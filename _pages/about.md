Research into the hydration habits among North Americans revealed that a significant 75% of adults fall short of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended daily water intake of 2.5 to 3.5 liters. Particularly, individuals between 20 to 39 years old only average about 1.5 liters per day. A survey we conducted also revealed that only 17.6% of respondents drank more than 2 liters per day. These figures highlight a widespread challenge: chronic dehydration is a common yet under-addressed health issue.

#### What are we doing about this?

To address this problem, our team has taken on the task of developing a smart water bottle that will encourage users to stay hydrated. We're focused on genuinely addressing the health needs of our users and contributing to better health outcomes for our society as a whole.


#### Advancing Technology for Hydration
Embracing the latest in technology, our smart water bottle is more than just a container - it's a hydration companion. Equipped with sensors, it measures the amount of water consumed and the frequency of sips taken. This data is then wirelessly transmitted to the accompanying mobile app, allowing users to monitor their hydration in real-time and receive hydration alerts.

Our in app trainer will be sure to give you personalized recommendations and provide suggestions so you don't have to do any work.

#### User-Centric Design
Understanding that individual needs vary, our bottle is designed to cater to a diverse user base. It comes in the perfect size and has an ergonomic design, making it convenient for people of all ages and lifestyles, whether they're athletes, busy professionals, or students. The bottle is also designed with a sleek, modern aesthetic, making it a stylish accessory as well as a health tool.


#### Looking Ahead
As we move forward, our team is dedicated to continuous improvement and innovation. We're already exploring the potential for integrating additional health-monitoring features into our smart water bottle, such as reminders to drink water, integration with other health apps, and even future capabilities like nutrient tracking. Our vision is to create a product that not only addresses the current hydration needs but also evolves with the advancing health and technology landscape.

With this comprehensive approach, we're not just offering a product; we're fostering a movement towards a healthier, more hydrated society.
