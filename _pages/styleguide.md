We are a group of 5 Mechatronics engineering students who share the same passion for fitness and drive for making the world a better place. As physically active individuals, we wanted to tackle a project that can make a widespread impact on our community by encouraging users to keep maintain an active lifestyle. We know how busy life can get, so our goal was to make being healthy easy and fun.
